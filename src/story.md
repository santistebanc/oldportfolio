## My story with web development#

It is a bit long, but it shows how I got into Web Development.

#### The beginning

I think I first started coding when I was about 13 years old.
At that time, the current fad at school was to play those online flash games found in websites like Miniclip, and Armorgames. I remember that as I played these games, I would often think of features I would love they added to the games, and that’s what got me into Macromedia Flash (now Adobe Flash). I wanted to create my own games, with all the features I liked, so I “learned” my very first programming language: Actionscript 2; and along with my brother I started to create flash games as a hobby.

I plunged into coding with absolutely no basic understanding of programming, I would just copy and paste snippets of code from tutorial websites and blindly tweak the values of variables hundreds of times with hopes of getting some shapes on the screen to move. In the end this actually worked (though it was a mess of code), and considering my complete lack of formal skills in programming (I didn’t discover the ‘for’ loop until a couple of years later since I started coding), I actually managed to create some quite impressive prototypes of games.

#### Moving on

Those first years of developing silly glitchy games where very fun and rewarding, I really came to love that feeling of achievement after having successfully crafted a piece of functioning software; but at some point I began to feel the urge to move on to developing something other than Flash games. I now wanted to create something useful, so I thought about building a todo app, and this time on something outside of Flash.

This started a period of deep frustration for me, my ignorance on programming began to surface and it soon became very evident that I didn’t know how to program correctly. For a period of over a year, I tried lots of different programming languages and frameworks, visual basic, java, python, c#. Each language took a long time to get started with, and gave me a real hard time as I tried to figure out how to accomplish even the simplest things.

The strategy of picking and tweaking snippets from random websites wasn’t working anymore, so I began to search for more in depth explanatory tutorials, where I could actually learn programming. Eventually, I got the gist of Object Oriented Programming and it all began to slowly make sense, I finally started to comprehend the structure of code and logic behind it.

#### Web Development

At some point during these years of exploration, I came across with JavaScript. And so I began to get into web development.

I think at first I liked JavaScript mainly because of that characteristic of it working on HTML pages where I could just refresh the document after every change, something I missed from Flash: not having to wait for long compilations and lengthy builds, just an instant preview of your program after a single keystroke.

Another very important characteristic I soon found from the world of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, was the fantastic plethora of resources and tutorials online readily available for all levels of programmers. Every question that arose while I learned, I could always solve right away from a google search.

After I learned the static part of the DHTML universe (HTML/JavaScript/CSS), I wanted to try some technology from the dynamic side. PHP seemed promising. With PHP, I created some rather unimpressive small mock-up apps which worked just fine, but nonetheless, I was very excited to make them; I felt this time I was actually doing some serious development, mainly because I deployed for the first time, a real, working, internet accessible, web app. In the meantime I also learned about databases, namely MySQL, I learned how to make and use ‘Ajax’ calls, and delved deeper into understanding the server-client interaction.

Also at about this time, I started college. The decision of what to study was easy for me, I wanted something challenging and related to IT, and so I chose to study Informatics Engineering.

#### Getting to work

By the time I started college I started to learn about the utility of certain things called frameworks. There were 3 or 4 popular PHP frameworks at that time, I read about the advantages and disadvantages of each and in the end I decided to give one a try: CakePHP.

With this framework, It was indeed a piece of cake to create a basic functioning CRUD application, but then when I wanted to add or modify a piece of functionality, I just couldn’t figure out how to do it; it was one of those frameworks where there was just too much magic setting things up for me.

I can recall for instance, at about one year after starting college, one friend approached me to help him create a kind of management system for a cousin’s family business (to register inventory and clients in a database, which by then, they did solely in excel), and I thought I could develop it quickly using CakePHP. I failed, I got very frustrated in not knowing how to make even simple things work, and I quit the project.

Offers of small informal jobs like this kept coming from time to time (as well as school projects), I accepted them without giving too much promise; in some I succeeded (kind of), but most I abandoned after getting discouraged.

I was learning a lot nonetheless, all this struggle got me into reading more theory about web development. I learned about other frameworks and tools to make development easier, for instance JQuery and some CSS frameworks, like foundation or bootstrap which I used through my projects. I learned about responsive design, design patterns, best practices, cross-browser compatibility, templating, APIs, basic web security, hosting, among other things.

#### Learning my way

During my years in college, I realized how gigantic the world of Web Development was, and how rapid it changed. I was overwhelmed, whenever I looked for a tool or library I would find dozens of other alternatives, then when I looked for which one was better, I would find again dozens of articles with different opinions, then when I finally picked one and finished reading a tutorial series on the library, I would discover that it was already obsolete, or that the newest versions work completely differently.

This reality of the ever-changing web technologies got me into adopting a casual approach to web libraries. I spent the years jumping from one framework to the next, as they came out or became popular; I would read an article about them, try some demo tutorials, and maybe if one was interesting enough, build a small app with it. But then, move on to the next thing.

The advantage was that I never got bored and got to try a lot of cool stuff, the disadvantage was that I never really learned to do anything complex; which meant that if one day I was presented with a project to develop a big app, I wouldn’t be able to pull it off. I noticed this, so at some point I thought, I should pick and settle with one big framework and learn it extensibly, so that I could finally be able to confidently take on complex projects. I researched a little, and by that time, the strongest contenders where Angular and Ember. I picked Ember, it seemed more stable, and better equipped for undertaking large projects (Now, in hindsight, I guess Angular would have been the better choice).

I really put a lot of effort on learning Ember, I read the whole documentation, followed lots of tutorials, even read books,... but in the end, I couldn’t make it work for me. The framework was perhaps too monolithic, too opinionated; the learning curve was indeed very steep (and they mentioned it in an article when I was deciding to pick it); but mostly, it just wasn’t making me terribly excited about it (like I was with Macromedia Flash back then). I lost interest.

I went on trying other new frameworks. One in particular, that caught my attention, was React. It was simple, yet effective, and it covered only the View part of the application; which is something I began to appreciate from frameworks, that is, that they weren’t an all-encompassing one-solution for creating Web Apps (like Ember), but they took care of single aspects of the application at a time. This meant that I could choose the backend, the ui, the routing, the database, separately and that any extra functionality I could just import from somewhere else, and not be forced to constrain myself to the framework capabilities. I liked that. 

By this time, Modularization on the Front-end was maturing and quickly becoming the norm. I started getting quite adept with combining external tools (now using npm packages and build tools), and I also started giving a real use to my github account (I had it for years before, but never really got to use it).

After lots of experimentation with different tools and libraries, I got convinced that the best ones will be those who do just one thing (and they do it well), are unobtrusive and agnostic to other tools in your app, and do not reinvent the wheel but apply commonly held best-practices and standards in the web-tech world.

#### New experiences

I was in my 6th semester when applied to a scholarship on a program for engineers from the german government (DAAD), it consisted of 6 months of studying at a german university, and another half-year doing an internship in some german company. It was my chance to go out there and have the so-called international experience. And it was an amazing experience, I cannot exaggerate.

At the university in Furtwangen, I registered in lots of fun and interesting classes, three of them related to videogame development (I had some optional credits so I could choose whichever subject I wanted). There I developed some unsophisticated but quite fun video games in Unity and Flash.

For the internship afterwards, I applied to a medium-sized start-up in Berlin. I was finally doing what I liked and getting regularly paid for it; and I was good at it, I figured that was what work was about. I enjoyed the casual, fun environment that seems to be guaranteed in start-ups, the flat hierarchies and culture of fast-paced team-work got me hooked, I now have a high regard for start-up companies. And Berlin is really one great place to seek these companies. I love this city, I have many great memories of Berlin and I want to come back.

Back in Mexico, I had still one more year to finish my studies.
